üïπÔ∏è How to Play

The game features two paddles, a ball, and a scoreboard. The objective is to score points by getting the ball past your opponent's paddle.

**Player One** (Left Side):
* **Move Up:** `W`
* **Move Down:** `S`

**Player Two** (Right Side):
* **Move Up:** `Up Arrow`
* **Move Down:** `Down Arrow`

**Game Controls:**
* **Quit Game:** `Escape`
* **Start/Reset:** The ball starts in the center and moves automatically. If a goal is scored, the ball resets to the center and serves to the opposite side.

* `stick.py`: Defines the `Stick` class, which handles the paddles' movement and boundaries.
* `ball.py`: Defines the `Ball` class, which handles the ball's movement, bouncing, and resetting.
